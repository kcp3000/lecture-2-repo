# lecture-2-repo

This is lecture number 2.

We would want a local verison of the repo so you can directly make any edits needed. 

1. git add . (or the READ.md or whatever name is the .md OR git add -A)
2. git commit -m "(any msg here)" 
3. git push -> basically pushes any of the changes made within the repo.

Repo is a workspace that either you created or cloned someone else's. It can be used to edit code, or jot down notes

Local is what you have on your system while remote is online; not on your computer

You create a repo through github

Go on git, get the SSH key, go to terminal, when in terminal put 'git clone (ssh key)' then press enter.
